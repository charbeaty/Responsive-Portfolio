            <p>Hi there! Welcome to my website! Since you are here, I guess I should tell you
              a little about myself. First off, I am a mother of two beautiful girls. They are my
              life and reason for breathing. I love to read, watch movies, and currently I love to
              watch reruns of Saved By the Bell. I love the outdoors, baking, and learning new things.
            </p>

      <p>
        I have an AS in Biology/Zoology from Southern Utah University. Right now I am in a coding bootcamp through
        the University of Utah. By the end of February I will a certified fullstack web developer. it's not medical
        coding or anything like that. I'm learning to make websites!
        I never thought of myself as technilogically savvy, but here I am. I have been working since I was
        14, so the workforce is not new to me. I have dabbled in janitorial, customer service, medical, and
        educational jobs. I like to think of myself as a well-rounded individual (in more ways than one ;) ).
